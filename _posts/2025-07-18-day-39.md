what_i_learned: |
  Today was focused on polishing and refining our project. I spent a good part of the day **finalizing the website**, making sure the pages were properly formatted and all links worked correctly. It’s exciting to see how far the site has come—it now feels like a professional hub for our project.

  I also worked on **troubleshooting Streamlit**, which we’re using to power our interactive dashboard. Some of the visualizations were not loading as expected, so I had to adjust file paths, check for missing dependencies, and make sure everything renders smoothly when embedded on the website.

  Towards the end of the day, our team came together to record our **weekly video blog**. We shared updates on our progress, challenges, and next steps as we get closer to wrapping up the project.

  Troubleshooting Streamlit was a bit tricky—it took multiple attempts to figure out why some graphs weren’t loading correctly on the dashboard.

reflection: |
  It felt good to focus on polishing things today. Finalizing the website and tackling Streamlit issues made me realize how important it is to test every detail before sharing the final product. Recording the weekly video was also a great way to reflect as a team on how far we’ve come and what’s left to do. With the website and dashboard almost complete, I’m feeling more confident about presenting our work soon.
