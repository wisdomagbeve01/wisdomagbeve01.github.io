what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the beginning of my 2025 CEAMLS Summer Research journey with Git and GitHub. I learned about the fundamental concepts of version control and how Git helps track changes in code over time. I practiced basic Git commands such as `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git status`. I also created my first GitHub repository, connected it to a local project, and pushed my commits online. 
  
  This introduction helped me understand how Git and GitHub work together to enable collaboration and maintain code history efficiently.


blockers: |
  I had some trouble remembering the correct Git commands at first, but after a bit of practice, it started to make more sense.

reflection: |
  Learning Git and GitHub was a bit intimidating at first, but working through the process gave me a sense of control and confidence in managing my code. I now understand how version control empowers collaboration and accountability in software projects. I'm looking forward to applying these skills to larger team-based projects in this research internship and in the future.
