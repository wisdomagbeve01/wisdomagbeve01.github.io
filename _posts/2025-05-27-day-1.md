what_i_learned: |
  Today was my official introduction to the 2025 CEAMLS Summer AI Research Institute for undergraduate students interested in AI research, and it set the tone for what’s to come. I learned the basics of version control using Git and how to connect a local project to a GitHub repository. I practiced commands like `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`. 
  
  I also took a placement test to assess my current Python skills. It helped me identify the areas I’m strong in and where I need improvement—especially around functions and file handling.


blockers: |
  I had some trouble remembering the correct Git commands at first, but after a bit of practice, it started to make more sense.

reflection: |
  Learning Git and GitHub was a bit intimidating at first, but working through the process gave me a sense of control and confidence in managing my code. I now understand how version control empowers collaboration and accountability in software projects. I'm looking forward to applying these skills to larger team-based projects in this research internship and in the future.
  The Bingo networking session was actually more fun than I expected. I connected with other interns from across the country and got a better feel for the community I’ll be working with. Starting with Git and GitHub gave me a sense of control over my work, and the Python test was a good reality check—it showed me I still have a lot to learn, but I’m excited for the challenge. Day 1 felt like opening a new chapter, and I’m ready to write a good one.
