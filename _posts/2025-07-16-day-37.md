what_i_learned: |
  Today was another productive day as we continue pushing toward the final stages of our project. I spent a good portion of the day refining the **project website**, focusing on cleaning up the formatting, improving navigation, and making the pages look more professional. Small changes, like adjusting spacing, aligning sections properly, and organizing content, are making a big difference in the overall presentation.

  I also continued exploring **Explainable AI (XAI)**, particularly using **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)**. I started reading more resources and watching tutorials to better understand how SHAP values help explain model predictions and identify which features have the greatest impact on flight delays. This will be crucial when we present our findings and need to justify why the model makes certain predictions.

  As a team, we briefly discussed our progress and upcoming goals to ensure everyone is on track for the final stages of the project.

blockers: |
  No significant blockers, but SHAP is a bit complex to fully understand at first. I’ll need more practice and reading to feel confident in applying it effectively.

reflection: |
  I’m starting to feel how everything we’ve learned over the weeks—EDA, model building, and now XAI—is coming together as one complete research project. Seeing the website improve visually is satisfying because it will be one of the first things people notice about our work. Learning SHAP is a bit challenging, but it’s exciting to dive deeper into understanding how our models actually “think.” With just a little more effort, I’m confident we’ll have a strong and well-rounded final presentation.
