what_i_learned: |
  Although I wasn’t physically present today, I stayed connected with my team virtually to keep our momentum going. I helped by reviewing some of our feature engineering code and suggesting improvements, especially around how we handle time-based variables like departure and arrival hours. I also supported the team with organizing our cleaned dataset and ensuring it’s ready for modeling.

  I reviewed resources on feature encoding (like one-hot and label encoding), and how to deal with categorical variables in flight data—such as airline names and airport codes. I also helped brainstorm the next steps for model evaluation, including what metrics we might want to use depending on the models we choose.

blockers: |
  Not being on-site made it a bit harder to collaborate in real time, but we managed to stay in sync through shared files and chat.

reflection: |
  Being remote reminded me of how important communication and documentation are in collaborative projects. I’m proud that I could still contribute to feature engineering tasks and planning, even from a distance. I’m looking forward to rejoining the team in person and continuing our progress on building effective machine learning models for flight delay prediction.
