what_i_learned: |
  Today marked our first in-person meeting, and I finally got to meet my Faculty Mentor, Dr. Kofi Nyarko, my Graduate Mentor, Abiola Olayinka Ajala, and the rest of the intern cohort. The in-person orientation was insightful — we were introduced to the goals of the CEAMLS Summer Research Program and learned how to position ourselves for success throughout the experience.

  We kicked off the day with a fun and collaborative marshmallow tower challenge, which helped build team chemistry. Afterward, we met with Abiola to officially start our research project. We began with the literature review phase, where I was assigned to gather articles related to: "Flight Delay Prediction," "Weather-Related Flight Delays," "Explainable AI in Aviation," and "Explainable AI for Flight Prediction." I also got hands-on experience refining my search using Boolean logic on both my university’s research portal and Google Scholar.

blockers: |
  There were no major blockers today. Initially, I was unfamiliar with the term “non-deterministic research,” but I was able to understand it better after the morning orientation and further clarification from my mentors.

reflection: |
  Meeting everyone in person added a new level of excitement and motivation. I felt energized by the team bonding activities and now have a clearer sense of direction for our research. I also practiced using Boolean operators effectively while conducting my literature review, which boosted both the speed and relevance of my search results.
