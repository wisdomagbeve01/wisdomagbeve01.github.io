what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the beginning of our **research paper writing** phase. As a team, we divided the sections among ourselves to work more efficiently. I started contributing to the **Discussion of Results**, focusing on how our models performed and what the key insights mean for improving flight delay prediction. Reading through some of our earlier notes and results helped me organize my points clearly.

  At the same time, I worked on the **final implementation of our website**. This involved checking formatting, updating content with the latest project details, and making sure the interactive dashboard is fully integrated.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today—just needed to carefully organize research notes to ensure everything in the paper aligns with our findings.

reflection: |
  Starting the research paper felt like a big step forward because it allowed us to reflect on everything we’ve achieved so far. Writing the discussion section also helped me better understand the impact of our results. Finalizing the website alongside this reminded me how close we are to completing the project. It’s exciting to see everything—data, models, dashboard, and now the paper—coming together so well.
