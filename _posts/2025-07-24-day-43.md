what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about **proofreading and refining our research paper**. We carefully reviewed different sections, checking for grammar, clarity, and consistency in formatting. I focused on making sure the discussion and results sections flowed well and that our arguments were supported with proper references.

  I also learned how small changes in wording can make explanations much clearer, especially when summarizing technical concepts for a research audience.

blockers: |
  Proofreading takes longer than expected because we have to check every figure, table, and citation carefully, but it’s necessary to ensure accuracy.

reflection: |
  Seeing the paper gradually improve with each round of edits feels rewarding. Every revision makes it look more professional and ready for the final symposium. It’s a lot of detailed work, but knowing that this paper represents weeks of research motivates me to make sure it’s our best version yet.
