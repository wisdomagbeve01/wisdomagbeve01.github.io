what_i_learned: |
  Today was a mix of technical work and research practice. I spent time learning and practicing how to **summarize research papers** more effectively, focusing on extracting the key points, methodology, and results. This will be really useful when writing our final research paper and literature review.

  On the technical side, I made significant progress linking our **interactive dashboard to the project website**. Now, users can easily access real-time visualizations directly from the site. I also started working on integrating **heatmaps** into the dashboard to make it easier to visualize correlations and patterns in flight delay factors.

  Overall, it felt like we’re getting closer to making the website a fully functional and informative hub for our project.

blockers: |
  Getting the heatmaps to display properly on the website took some trial and error, especially with formatting issues when embedding them.

reflection: |
  I’m happy with how the website and dashboard are coming together—linking them felt like a big step forward in making our work more interactive and user-friendly. Summarizing research papers also reminded me how important it is to clearly communicate technical findings, which will help a lot when we start writing our final report. The project is finally starting to feel like a complete package of research, data analysis, and presentation.
