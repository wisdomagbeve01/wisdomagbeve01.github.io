what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued building on the literature review for our project: **“AI-Driven Flight Delay Prediction Model for Climate-Resilient Airspace Management.”** I reviewed 15 research articles that I pulled from my university’s online library. These papers covered a range of topics like weather-related flight delays, machine learning models in aviation, and explainable AI tools.

  I also deepened my knowledge of **Zotero**. Yesterday I learned the basics, but today I really saw the value of the tool when it came to organizing references and properly citing sources. Zotero helped me stay consistent with the **IEEE citation format** we're using for our research paper, which saved me a lot of time and confusion.

  Later in the day, we had a **mock presentation** in the lab. I shared a quick overview of our project idea and what I’ve learned so far. It was a great opportunity to practice presenting technical content and get early feedback. My mentor, peers and other researchers gave me helpful tips on improving clarity and structure, which I’ll definitely use moving forward. This experience also helped boost my confidence.

  At first, I thought I could mix both **APA and IEEE citation formats** in the paper, but I later learned that consistency is really important in academic writing. My graduate mentor helped me fix it and showed me how to use Zotero to automatically format everything in proper **IEEE style**, which made things much easier.


reflection: |
  Today was productive and encouraging. Reviewing those 15 papers gave me a stronger foundation and more confidence in the research direction. I’m also getting more comfortable with research tools like Zotero, which makes the writing and citing process way smoother. Presenting in front of others—even in a mock session—helped me spot areas I need to improve. I’m excited to keep learning and building momentum with the team.
