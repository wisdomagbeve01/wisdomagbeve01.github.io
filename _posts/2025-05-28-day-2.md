what_i_learned: |
  Today I officially met my Faculty Lead and Postdoc Mentor. They introduced the title of our summer research project: “AI-Driven Flight Delay Prediction Model for Climate-Resilient Airspace Management.” It gave me a better understanding of how our work ties into real-world challenges, especially in aviation and sustainability. 
  
  I also attended Python 102, where we covered sets and dictionaries—key data structures that I can already tell will be useful in data modeling and preprocessing.

blockers: |
  It took me a bit to fully grasp the difference between sets and lists in Python, but working through the examples helped clarify their use cases.

reflection: |
  Meeting my research mentors made the project feel real and exciting. There’s a lot to read and catch up on, but I’m motivated by the impact our model could have. I also really enjoyed the Head Bands game—it was a fun way to connect with other interns and unwind after an intense day of learning. I’m starting to feel more comfortable in this space and more confident about what’s ahead.
