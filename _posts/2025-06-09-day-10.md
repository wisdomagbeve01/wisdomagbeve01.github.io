what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about getting deeper into data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. I practiced how to merge datasets and clean them properly in Google Colab.

  Some of the key skills I worked on included:
  - Using `.strip()` to remove unwanted whitespace in string columns
  - Using `.dropna()` to handle missing values
  - Checking for duplicate rows with `.duplicated()` and removing them with `.drop_duplicates()`
  - Exploring variable types using `.dtypes`
  - Renaming columns for consistency
  - Filtering data with `.loc[]`
  - Understanding how to standardize and reformat data
  - Generating summary statistics with `.describe()`

  I also created basic visualizations using `matplotlib` to understand trends in the data. Following along with YouTube tutorials helped reinforce what I learned and gave me more confidence with the pandas library.

blockers: |
  I had to spend some extra time figuring out how to clean certain columns properly, especially when it came to string formatting and handling missing values. But after a few tries and some video guides, I figured it out.

reflection: |
  Today made me realize that good data cleaning is essential before running any analysis. It was great to learn the basics hands-on and understand how small steps like stripping strings or dropping nulls make a big difference later. I'm looking forward to practicing more advanced visualizations next.
