what_i_learned: |
  Today was focused on refining the **Explainable AI (XAI)** component of our project. I spent more time working with **SHAP** to generate clean, understandable visualizations that highlight how different features influence flight delay predictions. I experimented with both summary plots and force plots to better explain what the model is doing behind the scenes.

  Alongside this, I continued building out the **interactive dashboard** that will help us present these insights to others. I worked on structuring how the model predictions and SHAP visualizations will appear together, using Python tools like Streamlit and Plotly.

  I also reviewed and cleaned up parts of our codebase to make sure everything runs smoothly and is easy for others to follow. We want our work to be not just functional, but also clear and accessible for future researchers or users.

blockers: |
  There were some layout issues with integrating SHAP plots into the dashboard. Some plots didn’t render as expected, especially when dealing with interactive visuals. Still working through how to make it seamless.

reflection: |
  It’s been really rewarding to see all the different parts of our project come together—from data cleaning to modeling to visualization. SHAP has given us a great way to explain our results in a more human-understandable way. With each improvement, the project feels more complete. I'm motivated to keep refining our dashboard and making sure everything is presentation-ready.
