what_i_learned: |
  Today was a hands-on and collaborative day. I made solid progress updating and modifying our **project website**. I worked on layout improvements, polished the content, and ensured it better communicates our work and progress.

  On the technical side, I continued learning and experimenting with **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)**—a powerful Explainable AI tool we plan to use in our model. I practiced visualizing feature importance and understanding how individual variables contribute to prediction outcomes. It was exciting to see the inner workings of our model become more interpretable!

  Later in the day, I met with my **team members** to work on our **weekly presentation slides**. We finalized the structure and key talking points, then recorded our **video blog update** for Week 5. We each discussed our individual contributions and explained our goals for the upcoming week.

  Some SHAP visualizations were a bit confusing at first, especially interpreting the summary plots. But after looking at examples and talking it through with the team, things started making more sense.

reflection: |
  Today was a good mix of technical learning, creative work, and teamwork. SHAP helped me understand how we can make our machine learning model more transparent, which is important for real-world applications. It was also nice collaborating on the weekly video—it gave us time to reflect on our growth as a team. I’m looking forward to tying everything together as we head into the final weeks!
