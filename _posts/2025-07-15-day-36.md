what_i_learned: |
  We started the day at the **Business Department** for the **SAIRI Cohort Connect session**. The focus was on understanding our **personality types, strengths, and weaknesses** through tests like **VARK** and **Myers-Briggs**. It was interesting to see how different team members learn and process information—some are more visual, others prefer hands-on or reading/writing approaches. Discussing these results helped us figure out how we can **support each other better** and work more effectively as a team.

  Later in the day, we met in the **lab** to continue progress on our research project. I focused on refining the **project website**, working on formatting and improving the overall structure to make it more professional and user-friendly. Each small adjustment makes the site look cleaner and closer to being ready for final presentation.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today—just making sure the formatting is consistent and everything aligns properly.

reflection: |
  The personality tests were a great way to understand how diverse our team is in terms of strengths and working styles. It reminded me how important good communication and collaboration are, especially as we approach the final stages of our project. The bonding session really helped us connect better as a team, and I felt motivated carrying that energy into our lab session. I’m happy with the website’s progress and can’t wait to see the final version come together soon.
