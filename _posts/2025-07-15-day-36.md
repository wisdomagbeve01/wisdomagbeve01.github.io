what_i_learned: |
  We started the day at the **Business Department** for the **SAIRI Cohort Connect session**. Today’s focus was on understanding our **personality types, strengths, and weaknesses** through tests like **VARK** and **Myers-Briggs**. It was eye-opening to learn about how each team member processes information differently—some of us are more visual learners, while others are hands-on or prefer reading/writing. Discussing our results helped us understand how to better **communicate and collaborate** as we work to complete our project.

  After the session, we met in the **lab** to continue making progress on our research. I spent time refining the **project website**, focusing on formatting and improving the structure to make it easier to navigate. Each update gets us closer to having a professional, polished platform to showcase our work.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today—just taking time to make sure the website’s layout is clean and consistent.

reflection: |
  Today’s personality tests gave me a better appreciation for how diverse our team is. Knowing each other’s working styles will make it easier to support one another and stay productive, especially as we get closer to the end of the program. It felt great to bond as a team in the morning and then transition that energy into focused work in the lab. I’m excited to keep improving the website and to see everything come together soon.
