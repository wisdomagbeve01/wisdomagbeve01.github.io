what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about **putting the final touches** on our project before tomorrow’s Mid-Summer Symposium. As a team, we made the final edits to our PowerPoint — making sure everything looked clean, consistent, and ready for presentation. We tightened up the talking points, added visuals where needed, and rehearsed our transitions between slides.

  We also spent a good amount of time going **back into our code** to refine parts of the model pipeline. This included:
  - Making sure the data preprocessing steps ran smoothly from start to finish
  - Cleaning up unnecessary code blocks and improving readability
  - Double-checking our model outputs and visualizations to make sure they aligned with what we planned to present

  It felt good to see the code, the models, and the presentation all syncing up.

  No major blockers today — just lots of detail work to get everything ready.

reflection: |
  The final stretch before presenting is always a mix of nerves and excitement. Today, we focused on making sure all our hard work over the past few weeks came together clearly. Looking at our progress — from raw datasets to clean code, visualizations, and a polished presentation — I felt proud of what we’ve built together. Can’t wait to share it with others tomorrow!
