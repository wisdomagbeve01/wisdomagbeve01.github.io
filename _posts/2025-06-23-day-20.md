what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about getting familiar with the **machine learning models** we’ll be using for flight delay prediction. I started by learning what a **baseline model** is and why it’s important—it helps us understand if our advanced models are actually improving results or just overcomplicating things.

  I explored how **Logistic Regression** can be used as a simple classification model and why it's a good first step before testing more complex ones. I also reviewed **Decision Trees**, learning how they split data at different points to make decisions and how they perform well even with non-linear data patterns.

  As a group, we discussed using **XGBoost** later in the week since it tends to give better results on structured data. We also started thinking about which metrics (like **accuracy**, **recall**, and **F1-score**) would be most relevant given our project’s focus on delay prediction.

  I wasn’t able to train the full model today because our dataset is still being finalized and cleaned. We’re also testing which features will be most useful, so it’s a work in progress.

reflection: |
  Today gave me a better understanding of how model selection works and why starting simple is sometimes the smartest approach. It also made me think more critically about which algorithms are a good fit for the kind of data we’re working with. I'm looking forward to testing out the first models once we finalize the dataset.
