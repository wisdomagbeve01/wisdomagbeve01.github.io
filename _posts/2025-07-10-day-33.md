what_i_learned: |
  We kicked off today with a **research writing session** in the Business School auditorium. The focus was on structuring a strong **literature review**, writing clear abstracts, and understanding the components of a good research paper. It gave me a better understanding of how to organize our findings, reference related work, and explain our methodology in a way that’s academically sound and accessible to readers.

  After that, I met with my team and **graduate mentor in the lab** to continue progress on our project. I spent more time refining our **project website**—adding updates and formatting sections to better highlight our deliverables.

  I also began exploring **Explainable AI (XAI)**. Since we plan to integrate tools like **SHAP** and **LIME** into our flight delay prediction model, I started watching YouTube tutorials and reading articles to get a grasp on how these techniques work. Understanding model transparency and being able to explain predictions to users is going to be an important part of our final product.

blockers: |
  Some of the concepts in Explainable AI were hard to grasp at first, especially how SHAP values are calculated. But I’ll keep studying examples and experimenting in code this week.

reflection: |
  Today was a great balance of research writing and technical deep-diving. Learning how to present our research clearly through writing is just as important as building the tech itself. I also enjoyed starting my journey into Explainable AI—this will be a critical next step in making our model more trustworthy and impactful. It feels like we're hitting an exciting phase in the project where everything is starting to come together.
