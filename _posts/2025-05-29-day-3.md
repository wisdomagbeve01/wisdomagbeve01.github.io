what_i_learned: |
  We kicked off the day with an introduction to Computer Vision using Google’s Teachable Machine. It was fascinating to see how quickly you can train a model to recognize images with just a few examples. Later, during Python 102, I practiced working with dictionaries in a breakout room and learned about file handling—specifically how to read, write, and append data to files using Python.

blockers: |
  At first, I had trouble understanding how file modes like `'w'`, `'a'`, and `'r'` work, but testing them out in small examples helped clear things up.

reflection: |
  The “Alone Together” game was one of the highlights of the day—it was a creative and surprisingly personal way to bond with other interns. It reminded me that even in a virtual setting, strong connections can be formed. I’m starting to feel like I’m part of a team, not just a program.
