what_i_learned: |
  Today, my team and I finished and recorded our **Week 2 video update**, where we shared what we’ve done so far in our project, including the research background, literature review, and the first steps in cleaning and exploring our data.

  We also learned about **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python and Pandas. EDA helps us look at our data closely before building any models. I learned how to:
  - Get concise summary of the DataFrame's structure and information using `df.info()`
  - Check data types and missing values
  - Use simple charts like histograms and box plots to understand patterns

  Our graduate mentor, **Abiola**, made it fun by hosting a **Kahoot quiz** to test our knowledge. We answered questions about basic EDA tools like `.isnull().sum()` and `dropna()`.

  I also practiced combining datasets in **Google Colab** using Pandas. I chose two CSV files and merged them using the `merge()` function. It helped me understand how to match data from different sources using shared columns.

blockers: |
  At first, I wasn’t sure which type of merge to use (`inner`, `left`, `outer`, etc.), and some of the column names didn’t match. After reviewing it with my mentor, I fixed the issues and got the datasets to combine properly.

reflection: |
  I now see how important EDA is—it’s like getting to know your data before trying to do anything with it. It helps you spot errors, trends, and surprises early on.

  Working with my teammates on the video also reminded me that communication is just as important as coding. Being able to explain your project clearly matters a lot.

  I’m excited to use what I learned today in the next phase our research project where we will conduct basic statistics and visualize trends using Pandas/Matplotlib.
