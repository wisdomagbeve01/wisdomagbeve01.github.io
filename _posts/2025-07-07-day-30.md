what_i_learned: |
  Today marked another major step forward in our project. I focused primarily on **building a dedicated website to host the interactive flight delay prediction dashboard we're yet to build**. I used **GitHub Pages** to structure the site, create navigation links, and format Markdown files for each section of our project. It was a good opportunity to apply web development fundamentals while also thinking through how to present our data in a clear and engaging way to non-technical users.

  In the morning, our full team met with our graduate mentor (Abiola), and teacher mentor (Kyle)to get feedback on our **Mid-Summer presentation**. We walked through our slides and received thoughtful, constructive input. Some of the key suggestions were about simplifying complex slides, providing clearer transitions between sections, and being more direct in how we connect our data processing steps to the project goal. It was a very productive feedback session that left us motivated to keep improving.

  I ran into some difficutlies working on the HTML for the website but I was ultimately able to debug it by watching YouTube videos.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me just how much **communication and presentation matter** in research. It’s not enough to just build models or write good code — we have to make sure our findings are accessible and understandable to different audiences. Building the website helped me think more deeply about how to **present our work in a user-centered way**, and the feedback from our mentors gave us a clearer picture of where to focus as we prepare for the final presentation.

  I’m also really enjoying the web development aspect of this experience. It’s rewarding to see the pieces of our research come together into a polished, shareable product — something that lives beyond just code and can actually make an impact. We’re entering the final stretch, and I’m excited to keep refining both the technical and storytelling sides of our project.
