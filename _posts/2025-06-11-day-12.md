  Today, we continued learning about Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is all about understanding the structure, patterns, and summaries of a dataset before doing any complex analysis or machine learning.

  I practiced how to find basic statistics like the **mean**, **median**, and **mode**. These measures of central tendency help give a general idea of how the data is behaving. I also learned how outliers can affect the mean, and why median is sometimes more reliable.

  We did a lot of hands-on practice with Python using pandas. I reviewed how to:
  - Check for and handle missing values using `.isnull()`, `.dropna()`, and `.fillna()`
  - Filter and locate specific rows or columns using `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`
  - Strip white spaces from column names or text data using `.str.strip()`
  - Use `.describe()` to quickly get a summary of a dataset (mean, std, min, max, etc.)
  - Group data with `.groupby()` for deeper insights

  I also experimented with simple visualizations to back up the summary stats, and got more comfortable identifying trends and patterns just by looking at numbers and distributions.

  To wrap up the day, we played a **Kahoot quiz** to test our knowledge. The questions covered important EDA functions like `.dropna()`, `.mean()`, and `.groupby()`. It was a fun way to review and reinforce what we learned.

  I sometimes had trouble choosing which method to use for cleaning the data, especially when it came to filling missing values. Watching short videos and trying out different techniques helped me improve.

reflection: |
  Learning EDA is like getting to know your data before asking it questions. It’s a key first step that helps avoid mistakes later on. Today gave me more confidence in reading raw datasets and figuring out how to clean and summarize them. The Kahoot game made the review fun and showed me what I still need to study.
