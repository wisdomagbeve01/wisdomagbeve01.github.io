what_i_learned: |
  We continued making progress on the **final research paper** today. Most of my time was spent doing the last round of edits and refining the **figures and tables** so they are clear and properly labeled. We checked alignment, captions, and formatting in Overleaf to make sure everything looks professional and meets academic standards.

  I also worked on improving some visual elements, like making charts more readable and ensuring that color choices make sense for interpretation.

blockers: |
  Adjusting visuals in Overleaf was a bit tricky at first, especially getting them to fit properly within the page layout. But after looking up some LaTeX formatting tips, I figured out how to resize and position them better.

reflection: |
  It feels good to see the paper finally coming together as a polished document. Making sure the visuals clearly communicate our findings is just as important as writing strong text, and today reminded me how much details matter in academic work. We’re getting very close to the final version, and that’s exciting!
