what_i_learned: |
  Today started off in the **business department**, where I got to explore **human-machine interaction**. One of the coolest parts was using muscle sensors to control a drone; it was wild to see how our bodies can connect with technology like that. It gave me a new appreciation for how tech can respond to human movement in real time.

  Later, I headed back to the lab to keep working on our **final research paper**. My team and I met with our **graduate mentor, Abiola** to review what we’ve done so far. We focused a lot on fixing our citations and making sure everything was properly formatted using **Zotero** in Overleaf.

  We also talked through a few final updates to our **project website** and started planning our **presentation slides** for the final symposium. We divided the work up so everyone knows what to focus on this weekend.

  Figuring out the references in Zotero took a little while, and we spent some time making sure our figures and charts looked right in Overleaf. But overall, no big issues.

reflection: |
  Today was a good mix of fun and focus. Playing with the drone was a great way to start the day, and then getting feedback on our paper helped us tighten things up. Everything is starting to come together—and even though it’s been a long process, it’s exciting to see the finish line so close.
