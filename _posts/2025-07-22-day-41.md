what_i_learned: |
  Today was an exciting milestone as our team traveled to **BWI (Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport)** to film our **elevator pitch**. The experience of presenting our project in such a professional setting was both energizing and insightful. It pushed us to deliver our key message: the problem we’re solving, our approach, and its potential impact in a way that was concise yet compelling.  

  Filming the pitch also gave us a new perspective on how to communicate our work to a broader audience. Knowing that the video will be **featured on our D-FLIERs website** adds extra motivation to make sure it represents our project well. It was great working alongside my graduate mentor, teammates, practicing multiple takes, and learning how to fine-tune our delivery for clarity and impact.  

  On the research side, I made significant progress on the **final research paper**, specifically on the **Data Used and Preprocessing** section. I refined the explanation of our datasets, clarified the selection criteria, and detailed the preprocessing steps we implemented to clean and prepare the data. This is helping strengthen the foundation for our methodology section and ensures the paper flows more cohesively.

  No major blockers today, just making sure that the paper sections align smoothly with the technical details we plan to present at the symposium.

reflection: |
  Presensting at BWI was one of the highlights of this project so far — it felt like a real-world pitch scenario, and it made me appreciate the importance of clear, audience-friendly communication. Seeing how our work will be showcased publicly added an extra layer of excitement.  

  Progress on the paper also feels solid, and completing the data section was a big step forward. With just a few days left before the symposium, I feel more confident that we’re pulling everything together effectively — from the written paper to the visuals to how we talk about our work.
