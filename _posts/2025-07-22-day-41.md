what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about preparing for the final stretch of our project. We spent time crafting and practicing our **elevator pitch**, making sure we could explain our project clearly and concisely to different audiences. It was a great exercise in focusing on the key points—problem, solution, and impact—without going too deep into technical details.

  We also made more **progress on our final research paper**, refining our sections and ensuring consistency across all parts. Additionally, we started **organizing materials for the final symposium**, including slides, visuals, and project summaries.

blockers: |
  No major blockers, just making sure everything stays consistent across the paper, presentation, and pitch.

reflection: |
  Practicing the elevator pitch was very helpful because it forced me to think about how to communicate our work in a simple yet engaging way. Progress on the paper is coming along well, and preparing for the symposium feels exciting—everything we’ve been working on for weeks is finally coming together. The next few days will be busy, but I’m motivated to make sure our final presentation is the best it can be.
