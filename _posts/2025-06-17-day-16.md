what_i_learned: |
  Today was focused on preparing our dataset for model training. As a team, we divided the different datasets among ourselves and began exploring each one. During this process, we discovered that some of the datasets had missing or incomplete values, which meant we had to pause and search for additional or alternative datasets that would work better.

  After finalizing our new dataset, we participated in a fun **Kahoot quiz** organized by our graduate mentor, **Abiola**, and facilitated by **Opeyemi**. The quiz helped test our knowledge in a fun way.

  Later in the day, Opeyemi led a long but insightful session where she broke down the full **data science pipeline** — from data collection, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation to deployment. This helped us understand where we are in the process and what to expect next.

  In the end, we were able to find a new dataset to supplement the one we dropped earlier, so we’re now in a good place to move forward with cleaning and exploration before training our model.

blockers: |
  We ran into issues with missing values in some of our datasets, which delayed our progress until we could find cleaner alternatives.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how important it is to deeply explore and understand your data before moving into modeling. I also learned that flexibility and teamwork are key, especially when things don’t go as planned. The pipeline overview session gave me a much clearer view of the journey ahead.
