what_i_learned: |
  Today started with a fun team-building activity in the Business Department. We played a "Titanic" game where we had to rank items we'd choose if stranded at sea — it sparked great conversations and teamwork.

  We also had the chance to meet **Mrs. Kyle**, a high school teacher who will be joining our research team for the rest of the summer. It was an engaging session where she shared her background and experiences, and we immediately saw how resourceful she could be for our project moving forward.

  Later, we regrouped in the lab to continue working on our dataset. After some exploration, we realized that one of our previous datasets lacked essential features we needed for model development, so we made the decision to drop it. This was a bit of a setback, but we quickly adapted.

  We divided responsibilities among team members and began cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing the newly selected data. It was a productive day with solid collaboration and forward momentum on our project.

  Dropping one of our datasets due to missing key features was a challenge, but we adjusted quickly and found a new direction.

  Today highlighted the importance of flexibility in research. Even with setbacks, having a strong team and clear communication helped us keep moving. It was also refreshing to meet Ms. Kyle — her insight and support will definitely add value to our summer journey.
