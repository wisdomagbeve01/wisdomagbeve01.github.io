  Today started with a fun team-building activity in the Business Department. We played a "Titanic" game where we had to rank items we'd choose if stranded at sea — it sparked great conversations and teamwork.

  We also had the chance to meet **Mrs. Kyle**, a high school teacher who will be joining our research team for the rest of the summer. It was an engaging session where she shared her background and experiences, and we immediately saw how resourceful she could be for our project moving forward.

  Later, we regrouped in the lab to continue working on our dataset. After some exploration, we realized that one of our previous datasets lacked essential features we needed for model development, so we made the decision to drop it. This was a bit of a setback, but we quickly adapted.

  We divided responsibilities among team members and began cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing the newly selected data. It was a productive day with solid collaboration and forward momentum on our project.

  Dropping one of our datasets due to missing key features was a challenge, but we adjusted quickly and found a new direction.

reflection: |
  Today was a reminder that research is rarely a straight path. Even though we hit a bump with our dataset, being able to reassess and pivot as a team was encouraging. Working in person helped us communicate better and make faster decisions, which made the whole process feel smoother. Meeting Ms. Kyle added a new layer of support — she brings an educator's perspective that we haven’t had so far, and it’s already proving helpful.

  The Titanic game reminded me of how valuable team bonding is, especially in long-term projects like this one. It helped break the ice, made us laugh, and reminded us that collaboration isn't just about work — it’s also about connecting as people. All in all, today was both productive and energizing, and I’m looking forward to building on this momentum tomorrow.
