what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about **tying up loose ends** on our research paper. My team and I focused on **finalizing the references**, which meant working closely with our **graduate mentor** to troubleshoot some of the issues we were having with **Zotero**. Thankfully, we got everything cleaned up and consistent.

  I also made a few small **tweaks to the SHAP waterfall plot** we’re using for the Explainable AI (XAI) section. The updated version is clearer and better highlights how certain features impact flight delay predictions.

  Toward the end of the day, we had a team discussion about our **presentation strategy**; figuring out the structure, what each person will say, and what visuals to include.

  Zotero formatting gave us a bit of a headache at first, but with some guidance and patience, we worked through it.

reflection: |
  With the paper nearly done and our visuals looking strong, it’s starting to feel real. I’m proud of the progress we’ve made, and today reminded me how helpful it is to have mentors who can walk you through the tough spots. Now it’s just about finishing strong.
