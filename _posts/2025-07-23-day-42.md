what_i_learned: |
  Today was focused on making more **progress on our final research paper**. We spent a good amount of time **transferring content from Google Docs to Overleaf**, making sure the formatting stayed consistent with academic writing standards. It was also a chance to review each section carefully and make small edits for clarity and flow.

  This process gave me a better understanding of how LaTeX handles citations, tables, and figures, which will be important for keeping the paper professional and well-organized.

blockers: |
  Adjusting the formatting in Overleaf took some time, especially with tables and spacing, but we’re gradually figuring it out.

reflection: |
  Moving everything to Overleaf made the paper feel more official and closer to a final draft. It’s exciting to see all our work taking a polished form that we can proudly present. Even though formatting can be tedious, it’s worth it to make the paper clear and easy to read. The final symposium is getting closer, and I’m motivated to keep pushing until everything is complete.
