what_i_learned: |
  Today I made significant progress on our research paper, focusing especially on the **Methodology** and **Datasets Used** sections. I worked closely with my graduate mentor to refine the content and ensure clarity and accuracy.

  We also completed final edits on our **elevator pitch**, polishing it for clarity and impact. In addition, I collaborated with my team to make final updates to our project website, including improving graphs and charts for better presentation.

blockers: |
  No major blockers todayâ€”just careful attention to detail while editing and updating.

reflection: |
  The paper is really taking shape, and it feels rewarding to see the Methodology and Dataset sections come together clearly. Finalizing the elevator pitch with my mentor gave me more confidence in how we communicate our work. Updating the website with the team reminded me how important good visuals are for sharing our research with a wider audience. Overall, I feel motivated and excited as we approach the final symposium.
