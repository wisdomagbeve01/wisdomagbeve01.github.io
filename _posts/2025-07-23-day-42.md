what_i_learned: |
  Today was another productive day as we continued moving closer to our final deliverables. I focused heavily on the **research paper**, making significant progress on both the **Methodology** and **Datasets Used** sections. Clarifying our model structure, data sources, and preprocessing steps helped strengthen the technical narrative and ensured everything is well-documented for our readers.

  In parallel, I worked with our **graduate mentor** to complete the **final edits for our elevator pitch video**, making sure it was clean, concise, and ready for public viewing. It was a great chance to polish the delivery and messaging one last time before it gets featured.

  Later in the day, I collaborated with my **team members to update our project website**, refining visuals and uploading the final versions of **graphs, charts, and figures** that summarize our findings. Seeing everything come together—research, visuals, and storytelling—felt very rewarding.

  No major blockers, though making sure the figures on the website and paper match exactly has taken careful coordination.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how many small but important pieces go into wrapping up a large project. Whether it's refining the wording of a methodology paragraph or tweaking the color scheme of a graph, every detail contributes to how the work is received. I’m proud of the progress we’ve made and excited to present it all at the final symposium.
