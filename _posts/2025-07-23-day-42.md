what_i_learned: |
  Today was a productive mix of deep technical writing and collaborative polishing. I spent most of the morning making significant progress on the **Methodology** and **Datasets Used** sections of our final research paper. Working alongside my graduate mentor, we clarified each subsection—focusing on how our model was developed, tuned, and tested, and how our preprocessing pipeline ensured the data was reliable and reproducible. This process helped me appreciate how important it is to tell a clear, step-by-step story in a research paper, especially when your audience includes both technical and non-technical readers.

  In the afternoon, we finalized edits to our **elevator pitch**. It’s come a long way since the early drafts—now it’s crisp, confident, and tells the story of our project in under a minute. Practicing it with my mentor helped me improve my delivery and focus on communicating impact over just jargon.

  Lastly, we came together as a team to make key **updates to the project website**. This included uploading new visualizations, charts, and final design tweaks that better align with our research branding. We also reviewed our code and cleaned up the GitHub repository to ensure it’s clear for external viewers who might want to explore our work after the symposium.

  None today. Everything felt well-aligned. The only challenge was making sure all the pieces—the pitch, paper, and website—tell a consistent story.

reflection: |
  The day was energizing because everything we worked on felt close to the finish line. Finalizing the methodology section gave me confidence in how we’re presenting our research approach. Pitch editing reminded me that less is more when trying to communicate big ideas. And seeing our website evolve into a polished showcase of our work made everything feel real. I’m proud of how our team has grown—and I’m excited to present our work with clarity and confidence in the days ahead.
