what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about **progress on our project website**. I made significant headway in building out the structure and design of our research site using **GitHub Pages and Markdown**. Most notably, I completed the **homepage**, which introduces our project, outlines its goals, and gives a clear snapshot of our focus on using AI to address climate-related flight delays.

  I also worked on organizing content across different sections—such as the "About the Project" page, our daily blog updates, and a placeholder section for the **interactive dashboard** we’re planning to link soon. I practiced using layout customization and YAML front matter to make each post and page consistent and readable.

  As I was building the homepage, I paid extra attention to clarity and design—making sure that even someone unfamiliar with machine learning or flight systems could understand what the project is about. I also experimented with adding visual elements like icons and links to mentor profiles, which made the page more engaging.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today, but I still need to find the best solution for embedding or linking our Streamlit dashboard.

reflection: |
  I’m proud of how much progress I made today. Creating a homepage from scratch may sound simple, but it really forced me to think about how we **communicate our work to the public**. What do people want to know first? What’s the cleanest way to present it? These questions guided how I wrote the intro, organized the layout, and chose what to highlight.

  It also felt great to see everything coming together—our research updates, team member links, project goals—all in one cohesive site. It’s becoming a real portfolio of our summer research journey. I'm excited to add the dashboard next and continue polishing the rest of the site after the break.
