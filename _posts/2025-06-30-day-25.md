what_i_learned: |
  Today, I researched how to create and host a project website using **GitHub Pages**. I started building a simple website to showcase our research progress and learned how to link markdown files, set up navigation, and customize the layout. This will help us share our work more publicly and professionally.

  I also explored how to create an **interactive dashboard** using tools like Streamlit and Plotly Dash. These platforms will be useful for visualizing our model results in a way that users can interact with. Additionally, I continued supporting my team’s work on the Mid-Summer Presentation by reviewing slides and sharing suggestions.

reflection: |
  Building a website is a great way to bring our project to life outside of code and notebooks. I’m excited about making our work more accessible through both the site and the interactive dashboard. It’s been rewarding to learn how technical and creative skills intersect in this process.
