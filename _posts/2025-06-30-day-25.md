what_i_learned: |
  Today was a really productive day! Now that I’m back in person, I rejoined my team and we made strong progress across several parts of our project.

  I spent a big chunk of the day working on **creating a website using GitHub Pages** to showcase our research project. I learned how to organize posts using Markdown, customize page layouts, and connect everything using Jekyll. It was exciting to see our updates and documentation take shape in a more visual format that we can share with others.

  I also started learning about how to build an **interactive dashboard**. The idea is to visualize our flight delay predictions in a way that’s easy for users to interact with.

  On top of that, we worked as a team to **finalize our Mid-Summer Presentation**. We're still making changes and improving our final presentation for clarity and flow.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  It felt great to be back in person and contribute alongside my teammates again. Being physically present made it easier to collaborate, ask quick questions, and share ideas in real time. Seeing our work come together in both the presentation and the website reminded me how far we’ve come since Week 1. I’m especially excited to keep developing the dashboard — it’s a cool way to connect our machine learning models with real-world usability.
