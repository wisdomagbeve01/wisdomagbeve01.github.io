what_i_learned: |
  Today, we focused on enhancing our Python programming skills, particularly in file handling. These exercises were incredibly helpful in understanding how to manage and manipulate data—essential for our AI project.

  We also explored foundational concepts in machine learning and large language models (LLMs), which gave me a deeper understanding of how AI systems learn from data and generate predictions. 

  I had hands-on experience with generative AI tools like Character.ai (for conversational agents) and Suno.ai (for AI-generated music), which was fascinating and showed the creative potential of these technologies.

  Later, in our breakout room, we participated in a fun and insightful exercise where we reviewed images to guess whether they were AI-generated or not. This activity sharpened my awareness of how realistic AI-generated content has become.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today. I’m still getting comfortable with some of the machine learning terminology, but it’s coming together with each session.

reflection: |
  Day 4 was packed with valuable content. The Python file handling practice built my technical confidence, and learning about LLMs and generative AI opened my eyes to how broad and powerful these tools are. The breakout room activity also reminded me how important it is to be critical and informed when working with or consuming AI-generated content.
