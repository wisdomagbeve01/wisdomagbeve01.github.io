what_i_learned: |
  Today was another productive step forward for our research project website. I spent a good part of the day refining the **formatting and structure** across different pages—making sure our homepage, daily blogs, and project description were clean, easy to read, and visually consistent. I updated headers, improved spacing, and adjusted the layout to make everything more user-friendly and accessible.

  I also worked on organizing links to our mentors’ profiles, research deliverables, and the upcoming dashboard page. It’s exciting to see how all the pieces are starting to come together in one cohesive digital portfolio that reflects our work.

  In the afternoon, our team took a break from screens and had a **team bonding session** with our **high school teacher mentor** and **graduate mentor**. We did a few activities to build trust and reflect on how we work as a team. We also talked about **how to present confidently**, especially when explaining technical work to a general audience. It was a great opportunity to relax, connect, and improve our team chemistry in a fun and supportive environment.

  No blockers today—just fine-tuning and polishing the layout.

reflection: |
  Working on the formatting helped me realize how important small details are when sharing research. Good design makes information easier to digest and shows professionalism. I also appreciated the bonding session—it reminded me that teamwork and communication are just as important as technical skills. The better we connect as a group, the stronger our final presentation will be. Overall, it was a well-rounded day of progress, creativity, and collaboration.
