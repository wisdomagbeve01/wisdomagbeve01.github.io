what_i_learned: |
  Today was a mix of **finalizing our research paper** and making real progress on our **presentation slides** for the symposium. We cleaned up a few more sections in Overleaf—mostly tightening up language and making sure everything flows smoothly.

  At the same time, we started designing the slide deck—figuring out how to tell our story clearly and visually. We focused on breaking down our methodology, key findings, and visuals like the SHAP plot in a way that’s easy for a broader audience to follow.

blockers: |
  No blockers today — just feeling a bit of that end-of-project pressure to wrap everything up well and finish strong.

reflection: |
  Seeing both the paper and the slides come together side by side made everything feel real. We’ve put in a lot of work, and now it’s about presenting it well. Excited (and a little nervous) for what’s ahead!
