what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about **finalizing everything**. We made the last edits to our research paper, double-checked our references, and ensured all the visuals looked clean and professional in Overleaf. It was a lot of small things—fixing captions, making sure everything aligned, and reviewing our formatting one last time.

  We also spent a good chunk of the day **practicing our presentation** for tomorrow. Each team member went through their parts while the rest of us gave feedback. We made small tweaks to the slides based on how things flowed out loud and tightened up some transitions to keep the story smooth and engaging.

blockers: |
  No major blockers—just the usual pressure that comes with getting everything ready for the final day.

reflection: |
  It’s hard to believe we’re at the end. Everything we’ve worked on over the past weeks is finally complete. Practicing the presentation today made it all feel real, and I’m proud of how far our team has come. Excited to share our work tomorrow!
