what_i_learned: |
  Today was focused on collaboration and planning. I met with my team members to work on our **weekly report video**, where we summarized our progress for Weeks 1 and 2. It was a great way to reflect on how far we’ve come and clarify next steps.

  We finalized the **datasets** we’ll be using for our flight delay prediction project. With that decision made, we began exploring and cleaning the data to get it ready for analysis. It felt good to finally get hands-on with the actual data we'll be using.

  Our **graduate mentor** shared a helpful **Time Series resource**, which is relevant since our data includes timestamps and delay trends over time. It introduced key concepts like temporal patterns, seasonality, and how time-based data is different from regular tabular data. This will definitely help as we dive deeper into model building.

  We also had a check-in meeting with our mentor to go over **expectations for next week**, including deliverables, documentation, and continuing our work with EDA and modeling.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today — just need to stay consistent with time management and continue reviewing the Time Series material.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a turning point where everything started coming together. Finalizing our datasets gave our project a clear direction. I’m excited to dive deeper into the modeling process, especially using what I’m learning about Time Series analysis. Meeting as a team helped keep everyone on the same page.
