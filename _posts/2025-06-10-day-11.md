what_i_learned: |
  Today was focused on building a stronger foundation in machine learning. I watched several videos that explained different types of machine learning models and how they’re used in real-world scenarios. One key takeaway was the importance of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**—not just for understanding the data, but for uncovering patterns, spotting anomalies, and deciding which models might work best.

  After that, I got hands-on practice with **data cleaning** using a very messy **Airbnb dataset from Kaggle**. The dataset had missing values, inconsistent formats, duplicate entries, and strange outliers. I spent time cleaning it up, dropping or fixing bad data, and getting it into shape for analysis.

  It was challenging, but also fun to apply what I’ve been learning in a real dataset. It helped me understand how much work goes into preparing data before you can even think about building a model.

blockers: |
  The dataset had more issues than I expected—like weird symbols in text columns and inconsistent data types. At one point, I accidentally deleted too many rows while trying to remove null values, but I caught it early and fixed it. It reminded me how important it is to check your steps before moving on.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that working with data isn't just about building flashy models—it’s about understanding and preparing the data first. Learning about EDA and practicing data cleaning helped me appreciate the "behind-the-scenes" work that makes good machine learning possible. I'm starting to feel more confident with tools like Pandas, and I'm excited to keep improving my skills.
