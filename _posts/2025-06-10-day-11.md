what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about getting a better understanding of **machine learning models** and the steps that go into preparing data for them. I started by watching a few videos that explained how different models work and why they’re used. One thing that stood out to me was the importance of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. I learned that EDA helps you really understand your dataset—like spotting missing values, outliers, or weird trends—before jumping into model building.

  After that, I got hands-on with a **messy Airbnb dataset from Kaggle**. It had missing values, duplicate entries, inconsistent formatting—you name it. I practiced cleaning it up: dropping null values, renaming columns, converting data types, and standardizing text. It was a challenge, but it gave me a solid feel for what real-world data is actually like.

  It took me a while to decide the best way to handle missing data. I wasn’t sure when to drop rows or when to fill them in. I also had to look up a few data cleaning techniques while working through the Airbnb dataset, but the practice helped me understand them better.

reflection: |
  Today helped connect the dots between theory and real-world data. Watching the videos gave me a strong foundation, and working with the Airbnb dataset made everything more practical. I’m starting to see how important clean, organized data is before even thinking about training a model. Looking forward to applying what I learned to our flight delay project soon.
