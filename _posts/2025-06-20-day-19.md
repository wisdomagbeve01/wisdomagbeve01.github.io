what_i_learned: |
  Today, our team focused on wrapping up our **data cleaning and preprocessing** phase — one of our main goals for the week. We finalized the cleaning process across all our datasets, handled missing values, and dropped null entries where needed to prepare for analysis.

  We also continued **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Pandas and Matplotlib. This included reviewing basic statistics like mean and median, identifying outliers, and visualizing data trends through bar plots and histograms.

  After that, we began some early **feature engineering** — brainstorming and creating new variables that might help improve our machine learning models later on. This included grouping categorical values, creating binary indicators, and extracting time-based features.

  We also worked on our **weekly team video**, documenting our progress and what we’ve learned so far in the project.

  Some datasets still had missing values in important columns, so we had to make tough decisions about which columns to drop or how to fill them appropriately.

reflection: |
  Finishing the week by reaching our data cleaning goal felt like a big win. Cleaning data might seem like a small step, but it’s a major part of building accurate models. Today reminded me how important it is to be patient and thorough — rushing through preprocessing could ruin everything we do later.

  Working with the team on both the technical tasks and the weekly video gave us a chance to reflect on how far we’ve come. Seeing our messy raw datasets turn into structured, usable data felt rewarding. I’m excited to move into the modeling phase with a cleaner, more refined foundation.
