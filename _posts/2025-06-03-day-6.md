what_i_learned: |
  Today was focused on starting the literature review for our research project, titled **“AI-Driven Flight Delay Prediction Model for Climate-Resilient Airspace Management.”** It sounds like a mouthful, but the goal is to understand how we can use machine learning and explainable AI to better predict delays—especially the ones caused by changing weather patterns.

  At first, it was a little overwhelming going through tons of papers, but I eventually got into a groove. I learned how to quickly skim abstracts, use Boolean search terms, and stay focused on topics that directly connect to our research.

  I also set up **Zotero** to help keep everything organized. It was a bit tricky to get started—especially syncing across devices and getting the browser extension to work—but once it was set up, it made a huge difference. Now I can save articles, take notes, and automatically generate citations when I need them.

  One challenge was figuring out which papers were actually relevant to our topic. A lot of the titles sounded useful, but the content didn’t always line up. Also, learning to use Zotero efficiently took some trial and error, but I’m glad I stuck with it.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a solid step forward. I’m starting to see how our project fits into a larger conversation around AI, aviation, and climate resilience. Having Zotero set up makes things feel a lot more organized, and I’m excited to keep building our research library and sharing insights with the team.
