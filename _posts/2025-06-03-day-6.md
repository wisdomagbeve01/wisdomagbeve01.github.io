  Today I officially started the literature review for our research project on flight delay prediction and explainable AI. It was a bit overwhelming at first—there’s so much information out there—but once I got into a rhythm, it became really interesting.

  I spent most of the day reading through papers about weather-related flight delays and how AI can be used to make predictions. Some papers focused on the models themselves, while others explained how to make these models easier to understand using tools like SHAP and LIME.

  I also set up **Zotero** to help me keep track of all the articles I’m finding. It took a bit of time to figure out how to organize everything and get it to sync properly, but now it’s super helpful. I can save papers, take notes, and even generate citations with just a few clicks.

  Figuring out which papers were actually useful was tough at first. Some looked promising but didn’t really match our topic. Also, getting Zotero to sync across devices and work with my browser took some troubleshooting, but I got there eventually.

reflection: |
  Doing a deep dive into the literature helped me see how our research fits into a bigger picture. Setting up Zotero was definitely worth it—it’s already making the process easier. I’m excited to keep building our library and share what I’m learning with the team.
