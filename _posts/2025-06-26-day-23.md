what_i_learned: |
  Even though I’m still away from campus, I continued contributing to our project virtually. Today, I focused on outlining a model training workflow for our flight delay prediction task. I created a checklist of steps we need to take—from data splitting and baseline testing to evaluating advanced models like XGBoost and LSTM.

  I also helped the team refine how we define our prediction labels (e.g., binary classification of delay vs. no delay) and discussed ways to handle class imbalance, such as using techniques like oversampling or adjusting class weights.

  Additionally, I reviewed some Kaggle notebooks and research papers on flight delay modeling and shared insights with the group on the types of features (e.g., departure time, weather, airport congestion) that tend to improve model accuracy.

  Still unable to run or test anything hands-on in our Colab notebook due to being remote, but I’m keeping up with the project and helping the team move forward.

reflection: |
  Staying involved remotely has taught me that good research isn’t just about coding—it’s also about strategy, communication, and preparation. I’m looking forward to returning soon and getting back to the technical side of things with the team.
