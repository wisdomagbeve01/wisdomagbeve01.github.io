  Today was our Thursday in-person session for SAIRI Connect. It was great meeting other research interns face-to-face. We played fun team-building games and got to know each other better, which made the whole experience more exciting and collaborative.

  We were introduced to **Overleaf**, an online tool used for writing scientific papers in LaTeX. It was my first time using it, and I learned how it helps with formatting citations, organizing sections like abstract and methodology, and working on the same document with teammates in real time. We’ll be using it to write our final research paper, so it was helpful to get familiar with the basics early on.

  I also read a research article that introduced the **HABA-MABA-AABA** framework. It’s a way to evaluate whether tasks in a system should be handled by Humans (HABA), Machines (MABA), or Assigned to Both (AABA). It was interesting to think about how humans and AI can work together, especially in fields like aviation and robotics.

  Overleaf was a little confusing at first since LaTeX is different from anything I’ve used before. But with practice and templates, I think I’ll get the hang of it.

reflection: |
  It was refreshing to have an in-person day and connect with others in the program. Learning about Overleaf and the HABA-MABA-AABA model helped me start thinking about the writing and human-AI collaboration side of research. I’m looking forward to building on this knowledge as we move into the next phases of our project.
