what_i_learned: |
  Today was our in-person session for **SAIRI Connect**, and it was one of the most engaging days so far. I got the chance to meet and interact with other research interns face-to-face. We played team-building games that helped us bond and made the research environment feel more collaborative and welcoming.

  We also learned how to use **Overleaf**, a collaborative LaTeX tool for writing research papers. It was my first time using it, but I’m already beginning to see how useful it’ll be for organizing our project report. We explored how to structure a paper, format citations, and work as a team on the same document in real time.

  Another highlight was reading an article on the **HABA-MABA-AABA** framework, which helps determine whether a task should be handled by **Humans (HABA)**, **Machines (MABA)**, or **Both (AABA)**. It’s a helpful way to think about collaboration between AI and humans, which ties directly into our project’s focus on AI systems in aviation.

  Later in the day, we met with our **faculty mentor, Dr. Kofi Nyarko**, to go over our progress so far. We discussed the challenges we’ve faced—especially around data quality—and brainstormed possible models we can explore moving forward. It was helpful to get his feedback and hear his suggestions on refining our approach.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how important community and mentorship are in research. Meeting everyone in person helped build a stronger connection to the work we’re doing. Learning Overleaf and the HABA-MABA-AABA model expanded my view of what it takes to build a strong research project. I also appreciated the time with Dr. Kofi, whose guidance gave us more clarity on our direction.
