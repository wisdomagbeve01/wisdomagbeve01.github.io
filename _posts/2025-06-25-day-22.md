what_i_learned: |
  Today, although I remained offsite, I stayed engaged with the team virtually to continue contributing to our modeling phase. I helped double-check the structure of our merged dataset, ensuring consistency in column formats and confirming that all missing values were properly handled.

  I also reviewed documentation on training/testing splits, stratified sampling, and choosing the right evaluation metrics for imbalanced datasets—which is important for our project since on-time flights far outweigh delayed ones. I provided notes to the team on these topics to guide our next steps in model training.

  Additionally, I explored the differences between models we’ve been considering, like Random Forests vs. XGBoost, and shared some comparisons that could help the team make an informed choice when we start training.

blockers: |
  Still limited by being remote, so I wasn’t able to test code directly in our shared Colab environment. I focused instead on research and documentation.

reflection: |
  Even while away, I’m glad I could still support the team by digging deeper into modeling theory and helping prep our dataset. We’re in a critical stage, and strong preparation now will help us build better-performing models later. I’m excited to return soon and jump into the hands-on work.
