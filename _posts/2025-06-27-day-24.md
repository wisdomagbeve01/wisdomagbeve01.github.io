what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the **Mid-Summer Presentation**, where all teams shared updates on their research progress so far. Although I was still away and couldn’t attend in person, I remained in close contact with my teammates throughout the day to support them as they finalized the slides and practiced their speaking points.

  I helped review the slide deck virtually, made edits to our model overview section, and ensured that key project components—such as our research question, data sources, methodology, and progress—were clearly communicated. I also provided some talking points and feedback to help my team stay on track during the live presentation.

blockers: |
  Still limited by being remote and not able to participate live, but I was happy to contribute behind the scenes and make sure the team felt prepared.

reflection: |
  Presentations are a great way to reflect on what we’ve accomplished and where we’re headed. Even from afar, I felt proud of the progress we’ve made and grateful to be part of a team that communicates well and supports each other. I’m excited to be back soon and help push the project into its next phase.
