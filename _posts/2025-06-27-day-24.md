what_i_learned: |
  Although I was still working remotely today, I stayed closely involved in helping my team prepare for our Mid-Summer Presentation. I supported slide reviews, helped simplify technical explanations, and gave feedback on how we could better communicate our progress and goals.

  Today’s focus was on refining our understanding of model evaluation. I reviewed materials on **accuracy**, **recall**, and the **F1 score**, especially in the context of imbalanced data like flight delays. I also revisited error metrics like **RMSE** and **MAE**—important tools for understanding how far off our predictions are and how the model behaves with larger errors.

blockers: |
  Being remote made it hard to actively participate in live presentation practice or spontaneous discussions. I tried to stay engaged by checking in with my team and contributing asynchronously.

reflection: |
  Even from a distance, I appreciated seeing our progress come together as a team. Helping with the presentation prep gave me a deeper appreciation for how important communication is in research. Reviewing the evaluation metrics also helped me better understand what “success” looks like in a predictive model—and how we can explain that clearly to others.
