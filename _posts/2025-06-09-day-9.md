what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on improving my skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. I learned how to merge multiple datasets and clean them by handling missing values, checking variable types, and standardizing data.

  I used `pandas` to explore and clean the data, and `matplotlib` to visualize basic trends. I practiced how to run simple statistical checks and create visual plots to observe patterns.

  I also got more comfortable using Google Colab and YouTube tutorials to guide me through hands-on exercises. The visualizations helped me better understand the data and made EDA more engaging.

blockers: |
  Some minor confusion while working with merging datasets and keeping track of column formats, but I figured it out with some extra time and rewatching a few tutorial steps.

reflection: |
  Hands-on practice made a big difference today. Being able to try things out directly in Colab while following along with tutorials helped me learn faster. I’m starting to feel more confident working with real data and using Python tools like pandas and matplotlib effectively.
