what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about finalizing and practicing our **Mid-Summer Presentation**. My team and I made the last edits to our slides — fixing transitions, formatting text, and making sure everything flowed well from start to finish. We wanted our story to be clear and convincing, especially since it’s the first major milestone of the program.

  We had a dedicated practice session where we presented in front of our **faculty mentor (Dr. Kofi)**, **graduate mentor (Abiola)**, and **teacher mentor (Ms. Kyle)**. They each gave us feedback on how to improve our timing, delivery, and clarity when explaining technical concepts. We also got tips on how to handle Q&A confidently and keep our audience engaged.

  No major blockers — just the usual nerves before a big presentation!

reflection: |
  Practicing with all three mentors really helped us feel more prepared. It was great to get different perspectives: Dr. Kofi focused on technical clarity, Abiola reminded us to be concise with our modeling explanation, and Ms. Kyle gave great advice on how to make the story more engaging. Presenting as a team also reminded me how much we’ve grown in just a few weeks — both in knowledge and confidence. I’m proud of the work we’ve done and excited to share it at tomorrow’s symposium.
