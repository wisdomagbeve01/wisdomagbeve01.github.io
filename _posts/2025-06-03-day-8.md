  Day 8 was packed with hands-on learning and meaningful experiences. The morning started with a tour of Morgan State University’s campus, which helped me better understand the environment I’m working in this summer. It was a nice break from the lab and gave us a sense of the community and academic spaces that support our work.

  In the afternoon, I worked closely with my graduate mentor, Abiola Olayinka Ajala, who helped me get started on the data preprocessing phase of my research. To build confidence, we used the Iris Dataset as a starting point. I learned how to load datasets into Google Colab, inspect the structure of the data, and identify issues like null values or incorrect data types. I used `df.info()`, `df.describe()`, and `df.isnull().sum()` to analyze the dataset and practiced handling missing values using methods like `dropna()` and `fillna()`.

  We also reviewed the importance of encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical values, and selecting relevant features—skills that will be directly applicable when I start cleaning the actual FAA and NOAA datasets for my AI flight delay model.

  The day ended with a mini-presentation where I summarized what I had learned so far to my faculty mentor, Dr. Kofi Nyarko. Presenting in a research context, even briefly, was empowering—it helped me realize how much progress I’ve made in just over a week.

  Initially, I wasn’t sure how to handle missing data or how to decide which features were relevant. It was also my first time fully working within Google Colab for data cleaning, so getting used to the workflow took some time. I had a few syntax issues at first, but working with my mentor helped resolve them quickly.

reflection: |
  Day 8 was a turning point for me in this program. I moved from abstract concepts to actual data manipulation and preprocessing, which is a critical step in any machine learning project. I appreciated how approachable the Iris dataset was—it made it easier to understand the process without getting overwhelmed by messy real-world data.

  Working with Abiola made a huge difference; he explained things in a way that made it click, and I’m grateful to have a mentor who is patient and knowledgeable. The presentation with Dr. Kofi also gave me a sense of accountability and helped me see the importance of clearly communicating technical steps and progress.

  I'm excited to move forward and begin cleaning and exploring the real FAA and NOAA datasets for our AI-driven flight delay model. This day really reinforced that I’m not just learning tools—I’m developing as a researcher.
