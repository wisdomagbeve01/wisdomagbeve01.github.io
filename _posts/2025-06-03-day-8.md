  Day 8 was one of our most hands-on and collaborative days so far. We started with a tour of Morgan State University, which gave us a better sense of the academic environment and made us feel more connected to the research space we're contributing to this summer.

  In the lab, our graduate mentor, **Abiola Olayinka Ajala**, guided us through our first major technical milestone: **data cleaning** using the classic Iris Dataset. She emphasized how essential it is to truly understand a dataset before writing a single line of code. Whether you're working with dummy data or real-world datasets from platforms like Kaggle, taking the time to study variable descriptions, data types, and sample distributions is a critical first step. She walked us through using commands like `df.head()`, `df.info()`, and `df.describe()` to explore the structure of the data and identify missing values or anomalies.

  We learned how to load datasets into **Google Colab**, check for null values using `df.isnull().sum()`, and apply cleaning methods such as `dropna()` to remove incomplete entries. This session helped solidify our understanding of the preprocessing pipeline that will be essential when we work with more complex datasets from FAA and NOAA.

  Abiola also introduced us to two powerful visualization libraries—**Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**—and explained how they help uncover patterns and trends that might not be obvious in raw numbers. While we didn’t build plots just yet, we imported both libraries and discussed functions like `plt.hist()` and `sns.heatmap()` that we’ll explore in more depth tomorrow.

  Later in the day, my teammates and I worked together on **PowerPoint slides** for our **Week 1 & 2 video update**. It was a productive collaboration where we outlined what we’ve learned, the research problem we’re addressing, and what lies ahead. We plan to meet again tomorrow to record the video and finalize our script.

  We wrapped up the day by presenting our individual and group progress to **Dr. Kofi Nyarko**, our faculty mentor. It was a gre
