subtitle: "AI in Aviation & Climate Resilience"  
project_title: "AI-Driven Flight Delay Prediction Model for Climate-Resilient Airspace Management"

problem: |
  Climate change is intensifying weather events that disrupt global air traffic systems. Traditional flight scheduling systems lack predictive capabilities that consider climate variability, often leading to cascading delays and passenger dissatisfaction.

  This project addresses the need for smarter, more resilient airspace operations by developing a machine learning model that predicts flight delays based on historical and real-time data, including weather variables.

approach: |
  The project will be executed in five phases:

  - Aggregate and preprocess datasets from FAA, NOAA, and flight tracking services
  - Engineer features such as weather anomalies, time of day, and airport congestion
  - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, LSTM) for delay prediction
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, precision-recall, and AUC
  - Simulate real-world scenarios to assess climate-resilient scheduling potential

  Tools include Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), Jupyter, and public datasets from FAA and NOAA. Collaboration will be guided by doctoral mentors and AI research fellows.

outcome: |
  The project aims to deliver a functional predictive tool for flight delay classification, a research poster, and a presentation. Results will include model comparisons, climate-impact insights, and a conceptual framework for integrating AI into national airspace decision-making systems.
